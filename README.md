This repository consists of implementations of the proposed EBCR method, which aims to improve similarity measurement used in collaborative filtering-based recommender systems.

To run the method, the [Surprise library](http://surpriselib.com/) needs to be installed:
  -	pip install numpy
  -	pip install scikit-surprise
  
After that the Surprise library is installed, run the method by:
  -	python main.py

This command will execute the proposed method (and its variants) on several benchmarks available in the [Surprise library](http://surpriselib.com/).
